Media website for Albatross Strategy. Here you can put a description and documentation for the website.

## Quick Install

Intall React by writing `npx create-react-app my-app` to the terminal and let it install. (If you installed it into your github folder, it will create my-app folder, where the react app is located in. Move everything finside from my-app fodler to the main folder and delete the empty my-app).

After installing react app, install sass compiler `npm install -g sass` in the terminal.

## Quick Start

Start development environment by putting commands into terminal:

... `sass --watch src/sass/index.scss src/index.css`
This will compile all sass files into index.css automatically when saving

... `npm start`
This will start the react live server so you can see the changes in realtime

## Sass

When you install Sass on the command line, you'll be able to run the sass executable to compile .sass and .scss files to .css files. For example:
`sass source/stylesheets/index.scss build/stylesheets/index.css`

First install Sass using one of the options below, then run sass --version to be sure it installed correctly. If it did, this will include 1.63.3. You can also run sass --help for more information about the command-line interface.

If you use Node.js, you can install Sass using npm by running
`npm install -g sass`

However, please note that this will install the pure JavaScript implementation of Sass, which runs somewhat slower than the other options listed here. But it has the same interface, so itâ€™ll be easy to swap in another implementation later if you need a bit more speed!

If you use the Chocolatey package manager for Windows, you can install Dart Sass by running
`choco install sass`

## React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
